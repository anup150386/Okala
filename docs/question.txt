Create an online repository (GitHub)
defining a simple containerised application built on docker microservices,
that can easily be deployed in a local environment.
With a single deployment the application must stand up by itself.
It must also manage connections to its own isolated database using a simple RESTful
API built in FastAPI, allowing for simple CRUD operations on two objects “users” and “projects”.
The relationship between these two objects should be considered many-to-many.
The “projects” table contains standardised polygon geographic information (with reference system ESPG : 4326)
and basic information about a project including name and description. A “user” will have a username and expertise.
